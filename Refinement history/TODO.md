# Refinement History Module TODO List

This document outlines the remaining tasks and enhancements for the `Refinement history` module.

## Pending Tasks

- [x] **Define Refinement Process**
  - [ ] Establish clear guidelines for what constitutes a "refinement" (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, architectural changes, security patches) and how it should be documented.
  - [ ] Define a standardized workflow for adding new entries to the refinement history, including required metadata (date, author, type of refinement, affected modules, summary of changes, link to relevant issues/PRs).
  - [ ] Create templates for different types of refinement entries to ensure consistency.

- [ ] **Tooling and Automation**
  - [ ] Explore and evaluate existing tools or develop custom scripts for automating the generation of refinement history entries (e.g., parsing Git commit messages, integrating with issue trackers like Jira/GitHub Issues, extracting data from pull requests).
  - [ ] Develop scripts or tools to assist in formatting, validating, and organizing refinement records, ensuring they adhere to the defined structure and immutability principles.
  - [ ] Implement automated checks to ensure new entries are properly formatted and complete before being added to the history.

- [ ] **Integration with Documentation**
  - [ ] Determine how refinement history entries will link to or inform other project documentation (e.g., design documents, architectural decision records (ADRs), user manuals, release notes).
  - [ ] Establish a cross-referencing mechanism to easily navigate between refinement entries and related documentation.
  - [ ] Consider generating a high-level summary or changelog from the refinement history for release purposes.

- [ ] **Review and Maintenance**
  - [ ] Periodically review the refinement history for completeness, accuracy, and adherence to established guidelines.
  - [ ] Implement a process for auditing the immutability of existing records to prevent accidental or malicious modifications.
  - [ ] Define a strategy for long-term storage and accessibility of the refinement history, ensuring its integrity over the project's lifecycle.

- [ ] **Tooling and Automation**
  - [ ] Explore options for automating the generation of refinement history entries (e.g., from Git commit messages, issue tracker updates).
  - [ ] Develop scripts or tools to assist in formatting and organizing refinement records.

- [ ] **Integration with Documentation**
  - [ ] Determine how refinement history entries will link to or inform other project documentation (e.g., design documents, architectural decisions).

- [ ] **Review and Maintenance**
  - [ ] Periodically review the refinement history for completeness and accuracy.
  - [ ] Ensure the immutability of existing records is maintained.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Created `Refinement history` directory.
- [x] Created `README.md` for the `Refinement history` directory, outlining its purpose and immutability.
