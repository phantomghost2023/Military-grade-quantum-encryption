# Refinement History

This directory serves as a comprehensive library for all changes and refinements made to the Military-Grade Quantum Encryption project over time.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this directory is to provide an immutable record of the project's evolution. Each file within this directory represents a specific change, decision, or historical state of the codebase or documentation.

## Immutability

**IMPORTANT**: Once a file is saved and completed within this `Refinement history` directory, it **must not be tampered with, modified, or deleted**. This ensures the integrity and accuracy of the historical record, allowing for a complete and verifiable audit trail of all project developments.

This approach enables us to:
- Trace the rationale behind design choices.
- Understand the progression of features and fixes.
- Revert to specific historical states if necessary for analysis or debugging.

## Usage

New entries should be added as separate, clearly named files (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_feature-name_refinement.md`, `YYYY-MM-DD_bug-fix_analysis.md`). Each file should detail the changes, the reasons for them, and any relevant context.
