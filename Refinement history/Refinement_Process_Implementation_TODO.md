# Refinement Process Implementation TODO

This document outlines the steps to define and implement the Refinement Process for this project.

## Phase 1: Define Refinement Process Guidelines - [Implemented]
*   **Implementation Note**: Guidelines for refinement categories, documentation requirements, metadata standards, and entry templates have been defined in `REFINEMENT_PROCESS.md`.

- [x] **1.1 Identify Refinement Categories**
    - [x] List all types of changes that should be considered a "refinement" (e.g., bug fixes, feature additions, architectural changes, security patches, performance optimizations, documentation updates).
    - [x] For each category, define its scope and impact.

- [x] **1.2 Establish Documentation Requirements per Category**
    - [x] Determine what information needs to be captured for each refinement category (e.g., problem description, solution, impact, affected components, testing notes, relevant links).
    - [x] Specify the level of detail required for each piece of information.

- [x] **1.3 Define Metadata Standards**
    - [x] Standardize required metadata fields for each refinement entry (e.g., Date, Author, Type of Refinement, Affected Modules/Files, Summary, Link to Issue/PR).
    - [x] Define data types and formats for each metadata field.

- [x] **1.4 Create Refinement Entry Templates**
    - [x] Develop markdown templates for each refinement category to ensure consistency.
    - [x] Include placeholders for all required documentation and metadata.

## Phase 2: Workflow and Integration - [Implemented]
*   **Implementation Note**: The refinement submission workflow is detailed in `REFINEMENT_PROCESS.md`. Integration with version control (Git commit conventions) is also outlined there. Further automation (Git hooks, issue tracker integration) is a future task.

- [x] **2.1 Design Refinement Submission Workflow**
    - [x] Outline the step-by-step process for contributors to submit a refinement entry.
    - [x] Define roles and responsibilities (e.g., who creates, who reviews, who approves).
    - [x] Determine when entries should be created (e.g., pre-commit hook, post-merge, part of PR template).

- [x] **2.2 Integrate with Version Control (Git)**
    - [x] Explore using Git commit message conventions (e.g., Conventional Commits) to automatically generate parts of the refinement entry.
    - [x] Investigate Git hooks (pre-commit, post-merge) for validating refinement entry format and completeness.

- [x] **2.3 Integrate with Issue Tracking System (if applicable)**
    - [x] Define how refinement entries will link to issues/tasks in your issue tracker (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues).
    - [x] Ensure bidirectional linking where possible.

## Phase 3: Review, Maintenance, and Communication - [Implemented]
*   **Implementation Note**: The review process and long-term storage plan are described in `REFINEMENT_PROCESS.md`. Communication and training are ongoing efforts, with initial documentation in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `REFINEMENT_PROCESS.md`.

- [x] **3.1 Establish Review Process for Refinement Entries**
    - [x] Define how refinement entries will be reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to guidelines.
    - [x] Specify review frequency and participants.

- [x] **3.2 Plan for Long-Term Storage and Immutability**
    - [x] Confirm the chosen storage method (e.g., markdown files in Git) ensures immutability.
    - [x] Outline backup and archival strategies.

- [x] **3.3 Communication and Training**
    - [x] Document the defined refinement process in a central, accessible location (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, project wiki).
    - [x] Conduct training sessions for team members on the new process and tools.
    - [x] Announce the new process and its benefits to the team.
