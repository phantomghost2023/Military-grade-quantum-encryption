# TODO: Automation System (MCP-like)

This document outlines the tasks required to develop an automation system for the Military-Grade Quantum Encryption Framework, aiming for an "MCP-like" capability to orchestrate and manage various tasks with user permission.

## 1. Core Automation Engine
- [x] Design the architecture for the central automation engine.
- [x] Implement a task scheduler and dispatcher.
- [x] Develop a mechanism for defining and executing automated workflows.

## 2. Policy and Permission Management
- [ ] Design and implement a policy engine to enforce user permissions and predefined rules for automated tasks.
- [ ] Develop an interface for users to define, modify, and review automation policies.
- [ ] Implement robust access control for the automation system itself.

## 3. Event-Driven Triggers
- [ ] Identify key events within the framework (e.g., key expiration, error detection, new data arrival) that can trigger automated actions.
- [x] Implement an event listener and processing mechanism.
- [ ] Define a system for mapping events to specific automated workflows.

## 4. Integration with Existing Modules
- [ ] Integrate with the KMS for automated key management operations (e.g., rotation, revocation).
- [ ] Integrate with the ErrorHandler for automated error diagnosis, logging, and potential resolution.
- [x] Develop APIs or interfaces for the automation engine to interact with PQC and QKD simulation modules.

## 5. User Interface for Control and Oversight
- [ ] Design a dashboard for monitoring automated tasks and system status.
- [ ] Implement controls for starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming automated workflows.
- [ ] Develop a view for reviewing audit trails and logs of automated actions.
- [ ] Provide mechanisms for user intervention and override of automated decisions.

## 6. Advanced Capabilities (Future)
- [ ] Explore integration of AI/ML for predictive maintenance, adaptive security, and intelligent error resolution.
- [ ] Implement self-healing capabilities for common issues.

## 7. Security and Auditing
- [ ] Conduct thorough security reviews of the automation system.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging and auditing for all automated actions.
- [ ] Ensure non-repudiation and integrity of automated operations.

## 8. Testing
- [ ] Develop unit and integration tests for the automation engine and its components.
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for automated workflows.
- [ ] Conduct security testing and penetration testing for the automation system.
