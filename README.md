# Military-Grade Quantum Encryption Framework

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a conceptual and software-based framework for "military-grade quantum encryption." It's crucial to understand that this framework will primarily leverage **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** algorithms and **simulated Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** principles to provide a robust, future-proof, and quantum-resistant encryption solution for development and production-ready applications and tools. This is *not* a true quantum hardware implementation, but rather a software-centric approach designed to mitigate threats from future quantum computers.

Our goal is to provide a highly secure, modular, and extensible encryption system that can be integrated into various applications, offering protection against both classical and quantum-era attacks.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
PQC refers to cryptographic algorithms that are believed to be secure against attacks by a quantum computer as well as a classical computer. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been standardizing several PQC algorithms. This framework will focus on integrating and implementing these standardized or leading candidate algorithms.

### 2. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) (Simulated)
QKD is a secure communication method that implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics. It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. In this software framework, QKD will be *simulated* to demonstrate its principles and integrate its key exchange mechanisms into the overall system, providing a conceptual layer of quantum-safe key establishment.

### 3. Hybrid Cryptography
To ensure backward compatibility and immediate security, the framework will employ a hybrid approach, combining established classical cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256, SHA-3) with PQC algorithms. This provides a layered defense, ensuring security even if some PQC algorithms are later found to be vulnerable.

## Key Features (Conceptual)

*   **PQC Algorithm Implementations:** Integration of NIST-standardized PQC algorithms for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signatures (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon).
*   **Simulated QKD Module:** A software module demonstrating QKD principles for secure key exchange, providing a conceptual understanding and integration point.
*   **Robust Key Management System (KMS):** A secure system for generating, storing, distributing, rotating, and revoking cryptographic keys, designed with quantum-resistance in mind.
*   **Secure Communication Protocol Integration:** Mechanisms to integrate the quantum-resistant encryption into existing or new secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL, SSH).
*   **API for Application Integration:** A well-defined and easy-to-use API for developers to integrate the encryption framework into their applications.
*   **Random Number Generation:** Emphasis on cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs) and potential integration with true random number generators (TRNGs).
*   **Tamper Detection & Integrity:** Mechanisms to ensure data integrity and detect unauthorized modifications.
*   **Performance & Scalability Considerations:** Design choices to ensure the framework can handle high-throughput and large-scale deployments.

## Detailed To-Do List

## Getting Started (Conceptual)

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.x (or preferred language for implementation)
*   Development environment (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)
*   Git

### Installation (Conceptual)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/military-grade-quantum-encryption.git
cd military-grade-quantum-encryption
pip install -r requirements.txt # (Conceptual dependencies)
```

### Basic Usage Example (Pseudo-code)

```python
from quantum_encryption_framework import QuantumCipher, KeyManager

# Initialize Key Manager
key_manager = KeyManager()

# Generate/Retrieve Quantum-Resistant Keys
# (Conceptual: This would involve PQC KEMs and simulated QKD for key establishment)
private_key, public_key = key_manager.generate_quantum_keys()

# Initialize Quantum Cipher with established keys
quantum_cipher = QuantumCipher(private_key, public_key)

# Data to encrypt
plaintext = "This is highly sensitive military intelligence."

# Encrypt data
ciphertext = quantum_cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
print(f"Encrypted: {ciphertext}")

# Decrypt data
decrypted_text = quantum_cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted_text}")

# Digital Signature (Conceptual: Using PQC signature algorithm)
signature = quantum_cipher.sign(plaintext)
print(f"Signature: {signature}")

# Verify Signature
is_valid = quantum_cipher.verify(plaintext, signature, public_key)
print(f"Signature Valid: {is_valid}")
```

## Security Considerations & Limitations

*   **Software Simulation:** It is critical to reiterate that the "quantum" aspects (especially QKD) are *simulated* in software. True quantum security requires specialized quantum hardware.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** The security of the framework heavily relies on the chosen PQC algorithms. Continuous monitoring of NIST's standardization process and cryptographic research is essential.
*   **Implementation Flaws:** Even with strong algorithms, implementation bugs (e.g., side-channel vulnerabilities, improper random number generation) can compromise security. Rigorous testing and security audits are paramount.
*   **Key Management:** The KMS is a critical component. Its security directly impacts the overall system's integrity. Secure storage, access control, and key rotation policies must be strictly enforced.
*   **Randomness:** The quality of random number generation is fundamental to cryptographic security. Ensuring access to high-quality, cryptographically secure randomness is vital.

## Recent Progress

We have successfully resolved initial setup and module import issues, ensuring the core framework components are functional. The entire test suite now executes successfully, demonstrating the stability and correctness of key generation, rotation, revocation, and hybrid key exchange functionalities. Additionally, we've implemented graphical representations of error trends to enhance debugging and monitoring capabilities.

### Frontend GUI Development

*   **Dashboard Redesign:** Implemented a new header, structured content cards, and updated styling in `src/frontend/frontend-app/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`.
*   **Navigation Integration:** Adjusted `src/frontend/frontend-app/src/App.jsx` for the new navigation sidebar, dark theme, and removal of the `Container` component.
*   **Navigation Styling:** Enhanced `src/frontend/frontend-app/src/components/Navigation.jsx` with the project logo, icons, and consistent dark theme styling.
*   **Error Resolution:** Fixed several frontend errors, including:
    *   Duplicate `import React from 'react';` statements in `src/frontend/frontend-app/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` and `src/frontend/frontend-app/src/components/Navigation.jsx`.
    *   An extraneous `</Container>` tag in `src/frontend/frontend-app/src/App.jsx`.
    *   Missing `@mui/icons-material` dependency, which was installed to resolve import errors.
*   **Development Setup:** Configured the frontend to display correctly by temporarily setting `isAuthenticated` to `true` in `src/frontend/frontend-app/src/store.js` for development purposes.
