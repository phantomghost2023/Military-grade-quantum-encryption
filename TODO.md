# TODO: Error Handling Suite GUI

This section outlines the tasks required to implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the error handling suite, focusing on a futuristic look and feel, and enhancing error visibility and management.

## Project Overview & Completed Milestones
- [x] Initial project setup and dependency management (`requirements.txt` updated).
- [x] Core backend automation engine developed and integrated.
- [x] Agent management system (`agent_manager.py`) implemented with registration, heartbeat, and task distribution.
- [x] Event management system (`event_manager.py`) implemented for handling system events.
- [x] Flask API (`api_interface.py`) created and integrated with `AgentManager`, `EventManager`, and `AutomationEngine`.
- [x] Resolved various `ModuleNotFoundError` and `SyntaxError` issues in backend modules.
- [x] API server successfully running and accessible.
- [x] Frontend `TODO.md` created to outline future UI development.

## 1. GUI Framework Selection & Setup
- [ ] Research and select a suitable Python GUI framework (e.g., Kivy, PyQt/PySide, or a web-based approach with Flask/React) that supports a futuristic aesthetic and cross-platform compatibility.
- [ ] Set up the chosen GUI framework in the project environment.
- [ ] Define the basic application structure for the GUI.

## 2. Core UI/UX Design & Implementation
- [ ] Design wireframes and mockups for the error display interface, emphasizing a clean, modern, and futuristic visual style.
- [ ] Implement the main error dashboard/view, capable of displaying a list of errors.
- [ ] Develop a detailed error view, accessible upon selecting an error, to show comprehensive information.

## 3. Error Data Integration
- [ ] **Standardized Error Messages**: Ensure the GUI can correctly parse and display standardized error messages from the `ErrorHandler`.
- [ ] **Custom Error Codes**: Implement functionality to display and filter errors based on custom error codes (e.g., `KMS-001`, `QKD-002`).
- [ ] **Enhanced Logging Context**: Design and implement a section within the detailed error view to present enhanced logging context (e.g., stack traces, relevant variable states, function origin).
- [ ] **User-Friendly Exception Handling**: Ensure that technical exceptions are translated into user-friendly messages for display in the GUI, avoiding jargon where appropriate.

## 4. Error Management Features
- [ ] Implement filtering capabilities (by error type, severity, custom code, timestamp).
- [ ] Implement sorting capabilities for error lists.
- [ ] Consider adding search functionality for error messages or details.

## 5. Data Persistence & Real-time Updates
- [ ] Determine a strategy for error data persistence (e.g., logging to a database, structured log files) that the GUI can read from.
- [ ] Explore mechanisms for real-time error updates in the GUI (e.g., polling, websockets if using a web-based approach).

## 6. Advanced Visualizations (Optional, for future)
- [ ] Consider implementing graphical representations of error trends (e.g., error count over time, distribution by type).

## 7. Testing
- [ ] Develop unit tests for GUI components and integration tests for error data flow.
- [ ] Conduct UI/UX testing to ensure responsiveness and adherence to the futuristic design.

## 8. Future Enhancements
- [x] Implement a basic root route for the API (`/`) to provide a welcome message.
- [ ] Implement robust authentication and authorization for the API.
- [ ] Add more detailed logging and monitoring capabilities.
- [ ] Develop a persistent storage solution for agents, policies, and events.
- [ ] Implement advanced task scheduling and orchestration logic.
- [ ] Enhance error handling and reporting mechanisms.
- [ ] Explore containerization (Docker) for easier deployment.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for all modules.
- [ ] Integrate with actual quantum encryption primitives and KMS services.
