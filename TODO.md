# TODO: Error Handling Suite GUI

This section outlines the tasks required to implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the error handling suite, focusing on a futuristic look and feel, and enhancing error visibility and management.

## Module-Specific TODOs

- [ ] Review and integrate tasks from [dilithium-py-KUMO/TODO.md](dilithium-py-KUMO/TODO.md)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Initial project setup and dependency management (`requirements.txt` updated).
- [x] Core backend automation engine developed and integrated.
- [x] Agent management system (`agent_manager.py`) implemented with registration, heartbeat, and task distribution.
- [x] Event management system (`event_manager.py`) implemented for handling system events.
- [x] Flask API (`api_interface.py`) created and integrated with `AgentManager`, `EventManager`, and `AutomationEngine`.
- [x] Resolved various `ModuleNotFoundError` and `SyntaxError` issues in backend modules.
- [x] API server successfully running and accessible.
- [x] Frontend `TODO.md` created to outline future UI development.

## 1. GUI Framework Selection & Setup
- [x] Research and select a suitable Python GUI framework (e.g., Kivy, PyQt/PySide, or a web-based approach with Flask/React) that supports a futuristic aesthetic and cross-platform compatibility.
- [x] Set up the chosen GUI framework in the project environment.
- [x] Define the basic application structure for the GUI.

## 2. Core UI/UX Design & Implementation
- [x] Design wireframes and mockups for the error display interface, emphasizing a clean, modern, and futuristic visual style.
- [x] Implement the main error dashboard/view, capable of displaying a list of errors.
- [x] Develop a detailed error view, accessible upon selecting an error, to show comprehensive information.

## 3. Error Data Integration
- [x] **Standardized Error Messages**: Ensure the GUI can correctly parse and display standardized error messages from the `ErrorHandler`.
- [x] **Custom Error Codes**: Implement functionality to display and filter errors based on custom error codes (e.g., `KMS-001`, `QKD-002`).
- [x] **Enhanced Logging Context**: Design and implement a section within the detailed error view to present enhanced logging context (e.g., stack traces, relevant variable states, function origin).
- [x] **User-Friendly Exception Handling**: Ensure that technical exceptions are translated into user-friendly messages for display in the GUI, avoiding jargon where appropriate.

## 4. Error Management Features
- [x] Implement filtering capabilities (by error type, severity, custom code, timestamp).
- [x] Implement sorting capabilities for error lists.
- [x] Consider adding search functionality for error messages or details.

## 5. Data Persistence & Real-time Updates
- [x] Determine a strategy for error data persistence (e.g., logging to a database, structured log files) that the GUI can read from.
- [x] Explore mechanisms for real-time error updates in the GUI (e.g., polling, websockets if using a web-based approach).

## 6. Advanced Visualizations (Optional, for future)
- [ ] Consider implementing graphical representations of error trends (e.g., error count over time, distribution by type).

## 7. Testing
- [x] Develop unit tests for GUI components and integration tests for error data flow.
- [x] Conduct UI/UX testing to ensure responsiveness and adherence to the futuristic design.

## 8. Future Enhancements
## 8. Future Enhancements
- [x] Implement a basic root route for the API (`/`) to provide a welcome message.
- [ ] Implement robust authentication and authorization for the API.
- [ ] Add more detailed logging and monitoring capabilities.
- [ ] Develop a persistent storage solution for agents, policies, and events.
- [ ] Implement advanced task scheduling and orchestration logic.
- [x] Enhance error handling and reporting mechanisms.
- [x] Implement consistent code style and linting (Pylint).
- [x] Add detailed documentation (docstrings, READMEs).
- [x] Conduct a thorough security review.
- [x] Enhance CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, linting, and security scans.
- [ ] Explore containerization (Docker) for easier deployment.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for all modules.
- [x] Integrate with actual quantum encryption primitives and KMS services.
- [ ] Create and manage records in the `Refinement history` directory.

## Automation System Tasks
### 1. Core Automation Engine
- [x] Design the architecture for the central automation engine.
- [x] Implement a task scheduler and dispatcher.
- [x] Develop a mechanism for defining and executing automated workflows.

### 2. Policy and Permission Management
- [x] Design and implement a policy engine to enforce user permissions and predefined rules for automated tasks.
- [x] Develop an interface for users to define, modify, and review automation policies.
- [x] Implement robust access control for the automation system itself.

### 3. Event-Driven Triggers
- [ ] Identify key events within the framework (e.g., key expiration, error detection, new data arrival) that can trigger automated actions.
- [x] Implement an event listener and processing mechanism.
- [x] Define a system for mapping events to specific automated workflows.

### 4. Integration with Existing Modules
- [x] Integrate with the KMS for automated key management operations (e.g., rotation, revocation).
- [x] Integrate with the ErrorHandler for automated error diagnosis, logging, and potential resolution.
- [x] Develop APIs or interfaces for the automation engine to interact with PQC and QKD simulation modules.

### 5. User Interface for Control and Oversight
- [x] Design a dashboard for monitoring automated tasks and system status. (API groundwork laid)
- [x] Implement controls for starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming automated workflows. (API groundwork laid)
- [x] Develop a view for reviewing audit trails and logs of automated actions. (Basic API for task history implemented; full audit trail requires persistent logging solution.)
- [x] Provide mechanisms for user intervention and override of automated decisions. (Manual task triggering via API implemented.)

### 6. Advanced Capabilities (Future)
- [ ] Explore integration of AI/ML for predictive maintenance, adaptive security, and intelligent error resolution.
- [ ] Implement self-healing capabilities for common issues.

### 7. Security and Auditing
- [ ] Conduct thorough security reviews of the automation system.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging and auditing for all automated actions.
- [ ] Ensure non-repudiation and integrity of automated operations.

### 8. Testing

- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for automated workflows.
- [ ] Conduct security testing and penetration testing for the automation system.
